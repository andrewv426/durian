BoxMethod :D
Algorithim: initially print String x for the top of the box. Then we want to use something similar to a pointer method where we simply print the character that is to 
the right of the character that comes before it (increase index by one) . A similar concept is applied to the letter on the right of the box, where we simply print the 
character to the left of the last letter of the String x (print index of the last character - index) . To dictate the spaces in between both letters it's simply the length
of the string minus the two characters that we will print. We can use a for loop to print each space. 
However, at the base of the box we want to create a end condition such that we simply print the characters that are supposed to be in the reversed string instead of spaces
